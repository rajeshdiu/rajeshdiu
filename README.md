### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rajesh


I am a Django and Python web developer with a BSC (Eng) degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University. My passion lies in Machine Learning, where I specialize in Data Science, Data Visualization, Data Wrangling, Data Exploration, and Data Extraction. Proficient in Python, Java, MySQL, and C, I'm well-equipped to handle data-driven tasks. I also have basic knowledge of Statistics, R, JavaScript, and Web Development.

My main goal is to apply Machine Learning to solve practical problems, aiming for a positive impact. Beyond work, I dedicate time to volunteering with special needs children and enjoy traveling with loved ones. Ultimately, I aspire to be the happiest, most successful, and best version of myself.
