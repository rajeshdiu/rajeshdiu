Hello,
I completed BSC (Eng) from Daffodil International University (CSE). My favorite topic is Machine Learning, I love dealing with it, it's a great subject. I think everything seems to be data these days. I have expertise in Data Science, Data Visualization, Data Wrangling, Data exploration, and Data extraction. I have deep knowledge of Python, Java, MySQL, and C. Basic knowledge of Statistics, R, JavaScript, and Web Development. I always try to solve real-life problems by developing Machine Learning. Everybody pray for me so that I can fulfill my all responsibility and I will try my own efforts. 
In my free time, I enjoy working with special needs children and traveling with my friends and family. At the end of the day, I aspire to be the happiest, the most successful, and the best version of myself.

I looking forward to working in the fintech sector (banking, insurance) and organizations with a particular interest in market research. However, I am committed to working and contributing to other dynamic sectors where the expertise of data scientists and statisticians can help.

Skills: Python | ML | Data Science | Data analysis | Data Visualization | Java | MySQL |
